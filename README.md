# Instacart EDA Project

For this project, you’ll work with data from Instacart. Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. This particular dataset was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. The dataset we've provided for you has been modified from the original. We've reduced the size of the dataset so that your calculations run faster. We were also careful to preserve the distributions of the original data when we made our changes.

Your mission is to answer each task, explain your work and prepare a conclusion that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. This project will require you to make plots that communicate your results. There are five tables in the dataset, and you’ll need to use all of them to do your data preprocessing and EDA. 

Task 1: Find and remove duplicate values. Describe your process

Task 2: Find and remove missing values. Describe your process

Task 3: Visualization
 - Verify that values in the 'order_hour_of_day' and 'order_dow' columns in the orders table are sensible (i.e. 'order_hour_of_day' ranges from 0 to 23 and 'order_dow' ranges from 0 to 6).
 - Create a plot that shows how many people place orders for each hour of the day.
 - Create a plot that shows what day of the week people shop for groceries.
 - Create a plot that shows how long people wait until placing their next order, and comment on the minimum and maximum values.

Task 4: Distribution
 - Is there a difference in 'order_hour_of_day' distributions on Wednesdays and Saturdays? Plot the histograms for both days on the same plot and describe the differences that you see.
 - Plot the distribution for the number of orders that customers place (e.g. how many customers placed only 1 order, how many placed only 2, how many only 3, and so on…)
 - What are the top 20 products that are ordered most frequently (display their id and name)?

Task 5: Insight
 - How many items do people typically buy in one order? What does the distribution look like?
 - What are the top 20 items that are reordered most frequently (display their names and product IDs)?
 - For each product, what proportion of its orders are reorders (create a table with columns for the product ID, product name, and reorder proportion)?
 - What are the top 20 items that people put in their carts first (display the product IDs, product names, and number of times they were the first item added to the cart)?

Good luck!
